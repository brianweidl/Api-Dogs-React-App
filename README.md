React application that interacts with the [Dogs API](https://thedogapi.com/).


 ## Key Features

* Single Page Application

- Filter through the API's  or database dogs

* SearchBar

* Add favorites

- Controlled form for creating your own dogs

## How to use

In the api folder, you will find an .envsample like this 

    DB_USER=
    DB_PASSWORD=
    DB_HOST=
    YOUR_API_KEY=
    
Create an .env file in the api folder with your postgreSQL credentials and your API key ([Create one here!](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)). Also, you will need to create a database called "food".

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com/)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

$ cd api
# Install dependencies
